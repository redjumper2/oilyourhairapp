  Current Status

  - ✅ Professional, modern design
  - ✅ Fully responsive (desktop/mobile)
  - ✅ Smooth animations and interactions
  - ⚠️ Marked as "Website in progress"
  - ❌ No actual e-commerce functionality (no shopping cart/checkout)
  - ❌ No admin panel (admin directory doesn't exist)
  - ❌ Products are placeholder/demo content

  What It's NOT

  - Not connected to any backend/database
  - No payment processing
  - No actual inventory system
  - Static site only (no dynamic content)

  This appears to be a high-quality website template/mockup for a hair care oil business, ready to be connected to actual e-commerce functionality. The design is professional and production-ready, but needs backend integration to actually sell products.

  Is this a project you're developing, or are you planning to add e-commerce functionality to it?

> Dont generate 

● Understood. I've scanned and analyzed the website - it's a static HTML/CSS/JS site for a premium natural hair oils business called OilYourHair, currently marked as "in progress" with demo products and no backend e-commerce functionality yet.

> I would like to make an multi-tenant ecommerce backend.  My immediate goal is to:

1. build an auth backend that can assign an organization and role to a user that uses Google or Shopify OIDC/OAuth2 to identify 
themselves
2. After that, I need to create a product catalog administration backend api for users who are in the main organization and are 
administrators.
3. An API for uploading a CSV file with information about each product and link to image/video about the product for display 
later 

What do u think?  Don't generate. 

● Good approach - you're building this incrementally in the right order. A few thoughts:

  Architecture makes sense:
  - Multi-tenant from day one is smart (easier than retrofitting later)
  - Auth first is correct - everything depends on it
  - Organization + role model gives you flexibility (can have multiple stores, different admin levels)

  On the auth (step 1):
  - Google OAuth is straightforward, widely trusted
  - Shopify OAuth is interesting - are you building a Shopify app, or just using Shopify as an identity provider? (Different integration patterns)
  - Organization assignment: how does a new user get assigned? Auto-create org on first login, or invite-only?

  On product catalog API (step 2):
  - "Main organization" - so you have one org that's special? Or multiple independent orgs?
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) - you'll want granular permissions (can view products vs can edit vs can publish, etc.)

  On CSV upload (step 3):
  - Good for bulk imports
  - Image/video links - are these URLs to existing files, or will you need file upload too?
  - Validation is critical - bad CSV data can mess up your catalog
  - Large CSVs - you'll want async processing (queue system) so it doesn't timeout

  Considerations:
  - Database: MongoDB (you already have it), Postgres (better for relational/multi-tenant), or something else?
  - Media storage: Images/videos need CDN (Cloudflare R2, S3, etc.)
  - API design: REST or GraphQL?
  - How does this connect to the static oilyourhair.com site? Will you rebuild the frontend to consume this API?

  Potential scope creep to watch:
  - Customer-facing features (cart, checkout, orders) - not in your immediate goals, good
  - Inventory management - mentioned or not?
  - Multi-currency, shipping, taxes - leave for later?

  Solid plan overall. Building blocks in the right order.
